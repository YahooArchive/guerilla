## Roadmap

Guerilla requires nodejs v0.12 or greater, and only supports the [ES6 features](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28388885/ecmascript-6-features-available-in-node-js-0-12) that are enabled without the ```--harmony``` flag.

### Plan to add ES6 Support

* Use the Babel compiler, to allow ES6 features to be used in v0.12
* At some future point (aligned to the [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS)?), update the supported engines in package.json.

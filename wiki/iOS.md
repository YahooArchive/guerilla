## Configure for iOS

### Install XCode + Command Line Tools

Install the latest version of Xcode from the App Store. Once it's downloaded, launch Xcode and accept the terms and conditions. Xcode will then install the command line tools.

### Additional Notes

Make sure you have:

- the appropriate iOS licenses, certificates and provisioning profiles
- put your Mac into developer mode by manually installing atleast one application on a device via Xcode
